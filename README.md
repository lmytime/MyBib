Tool to optimize citekey of bibtex to Author+Year.

<h2>Hello</h2>
This webpage is designed to optimize citekeys of bibtex file. <br>
The citekey of bibtex file generated by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/">NASA/ADS</a> is its bibcode. <br>
But I think maybe "Author+Year" is better, at least for myself. <br>
For example, the citekey of the paper "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter KÃ¶rper" is "1905AnP...322..891E". <br>
And I prefer to use "Einstein1905" or "Einstein:1905". <br>
This pushed me to build this webpage. <br>
And please give me a <a href="https://github.com/lmytime/MyBib">star</a> if you think this webpage is helpful. <br><br>
